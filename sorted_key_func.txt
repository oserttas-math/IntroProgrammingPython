'''
‘key’ which takes a function as its value. This key function transforms
each element before sorting, it takes the value and returns 1 value which is
then used within sort instead of the original value.
# Sort a list of integers based on
# their remainder on dividing from 7

def func(x):
    return x % 7

L = [15, 3, 11, 7]

print "Normal sort :", sorted(L)
print "Sorted with key:", sorted(L, key = func)

Output :
Normal sort : [3, 7, 11, 15]
Sorted with key: [7, 15, 3, 11]

L = ["cccc", "b", "dd", "aaa"]

print "Normal sort :", sorted(L)

print "Sort with len :", sorted(L, key = len)

Output :
Normal sort : ['aaa', 'b', 'cccc', 'dd']
Sort with len : ['b', 'dd', 'aaa', 'cccc']
